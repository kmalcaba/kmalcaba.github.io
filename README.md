# Portfolio

Hello! This is the source code of my [portfolio site](https://kmalcaba.github.io/).

## Overview

This portfolio project is used to showcase my React and SCSS skills, as well as to display my featured personal projects and a way to contact me.

## Built with

- React
- SCSS
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Framer-motion

## What I learned

I originally wanted to do this project with `styled-components` in mind instead of SCSS. I've tried it before but creating separate styled components with the CSS and the actual StyledComponent itself proved to be tedious for a simple portfolio website. So I decided to dip my toes in SCSS and my progress went a lot faster and smoother when building the components and the layout of the website itself.

The layout of the website right now is not what I had intended, at first. I think 50% of the original design remained, while everything else, including the colors, font family, and button styles became different as I was building the website. It really showed that no matter how much you plan, it will not always go accordingly. And that's okay!

I also learned about framer-motion! This is my first project using it and it is _so_ satisfying to animate components like that. I watched a YouTube tutorial and read through the documentation to be able to achieve what I currently have in the project.

### Useful resources

- [Build and Deploy a Fullstack Responsive Portfolio Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HNyXCPDQ7Q) - I watched this tutorial for inspiration on the design I ended up adopting for my portfolio (though I took a more minimalist approach). This is also where I encountered framer-motion for the first time and it was easy to understand from this tutorial.
